# 🏡 US Household Income Analysis

This project focuses on cleaning, exploring, and analyzing US household income data using SQL. It aims to resolve data inconsistencies, uncover regional income trends, and provide insights into household income distributions across states and cities.

## 📊 Project Objectives

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Resolve duplicate records.
   - Standardize inconsistent entries (e.g., state names, place types).
   - Address missing or incorrect data fields.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyze land and water area distributions by state.
   - Investigate household income patterns (mean and median) across regions.
   - Highlight disparities in income based on location and demographic details.

3. **Data Integration**:
   - Combine datasets to enrich analysis and derive deeper insights.

## 📁 Datasets Used

1. **`USHouseholdIncome.csv`**:
   - Contains geographical and demographic household income data.
   - Includes details like state, county, city, area type, and land/water area.

2. **`USHouseholdIncome_Statistics.csv`**:
   - Provides statistical metrics like mean and median household incomes.
